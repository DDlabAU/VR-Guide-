What is VR with unreal engine > examples ðŸ˜Š 

Unreal engine is   a game engine developed by Epic Games, is a real-time 3D creation tool. It allow to create , interactive experiences, and immersive virtual worlds

Intro of interface
What are maps?   Maps are folder that contain each Blueprint code, textures , mash , text for your game 

when to use vr mode

you can find both maps under VirtualRealityBP/Maps/ in your Content Browser.

Blueprint scripts examples 

What is Blueprints scripts
The Blueprints Visual Scripting system in Unreal Engine is a complete gameplay scripting system based on the concept of using a node-based interface to create gameplay elements from within Unreal Editor. As with many common scripting languages, it is used to define object-oriented (OO) classes or objects in the engine. As you use UE4, you'll often find that objects defined using Blueprint are colloquially referred to as just "Blueprints." 
 Blueprint-specific markup available in Unreal Engine's C++ implementation enables programmers to create baseline systems   

What  each single node does?  Nodes are objects such as events, function calls, flow control operations, variables, etc. that can be used in graphs to define the functionality of the particular graph and Blueprint that contains it.


When to use blueprints : when you want to create a script to a functions like: 
â€¢	Blueprint Variables
â€¢	Set and Get an Actor Reference

â€¢	Events
â€¢	Nodes
â€¢	Array 
â€¢	structure

Optional plugins 
Using Unreal engine it is possible to add different plug-ins to allow interact with different software and engine. 
Examples are the plug in with Arduino that allow to create interaction control in the real world and in the virtual world 
Or you can use Unreal.JS if you feel more confident to write a code in Javascript. 
There are many others that you can use and experiment with.
